 abstract = {Importance sampling uses observations from one distribution to estimate for another distribution by weighting the observations. Including the target distribution as one component of a mixture distribution bounds the weights and makes importance sampling more reliable. The usual importance-sampling estimate is a weighted average with weights that do not sum to 1. We discuss simple normalization and other, more efficient normalization methods. These innovations make importance sampling useful in a wider variety of problems. We demonstrate with a case study of oil-inventory reliability at a large utility.},
